Systematic bias favours products which are made by the company funding the research. Explanations 
include the selection of an inappropriate comparator to the product being investigated and publication
bias (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12775614)
 
Conflict of interest (or competing interest) statements and medline metadata describe the funding 
of research and potential sources of bias.

We made a tool for visualising and tracking relationships between papers and their conflict of interests.

Later we might make a simple measure, the conflict of interest index, which describes the proportion of 
papers for a given drug treatment, that have received industry funding or declare a conflict of interest. 

It also might integrate with www.openbnf.org and www.burningyourmoney.org :-)

Conflict of interestz!
